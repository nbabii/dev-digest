# `repo-intel` — the codebase indexer

`repo-intel` reads a cloned repository **once on clone** (and incrementally on
fetch, keyed by file content hash) and turns it into queryable facts: symbols,
the import graph, a PageRank-based file importance score, and a compact **repo
map** (the project skeleton). On a review it is only **read** — the index is
already computed, so adding context to a prompt costs no analysis at request time.

This is **starter infrastructure**: it works from day 1 (the **Indexed** badge),
but you don't write it. Course lessons build features _on top_ of its facade —
Blast Radius (L04), Conventions samples (L02), Onboarding reading-path (L05),
the Phantom-API gate (L06) — by calling `repoIntel.*`, not by re-indexing.

## Pipeline

  CLONE["git clone / fetch"] --> WALK["walk.ts<br/>discover source files"]
  WALK --> AST["ast-grep adapter<br/>symbols + references"]
  AST --> EDGES["import graph<br/>(dependency-cruiser)"]
  EDGES --> RANK["rank.ts<br/>PageRank + git hotness → file rank"]
  RANK --> MAP["repo-map.ts<br/>compact repo skeleton (cached)"]
  AST --> DB[("Postgres<br/>symbols · references · file_edges · file_rank · repo_map_cache")]
  EDGES --> DB
  RANK --> DB
  MAP --> DB
```

Full vs incremental indexing lives in `pipeline/{full,incremental}.ts`; an
unindexed or partially-indexed repo degrades gracefully (the facade returns empty
results rather than throwing).

## Facade (`repoIntel.*`)

Everything downstream reads through one facade (`service.ts`) so consumers never
touch the pipeline internals:

- `getRepoMap(repoId)` → the cached repo skeleton (fed into the **review prompt**).
- `getFileRank(repoId, files)` → importance percentile per changed file.
- `getCallerSignatures(repoId, files, limit)` → callers of changed symbols.
- `getBlastRadius(repoId, files)` → impacted symbols / callers. Consumed by
  `modules/blast` (`GET /pulls/:id/blast-radius`). On the persistent path it
  returns **every** resolved caller row (capped only by a SQL hard cap,
  `BLAST_MAX_CALLER_ROWS = 5000`, which sets `callersTruncated`); the per-symbol
  cap (`MAX_CALLERS_PER_SYMBOL`) is the consumer's job, not applied globally.
  Caller rows carry `declFile` so consumers can group by `(declFile, symbol)`.
  Without a usable index it silently falls back to ripgrep over the clone and
  returns `degraded: true` — read-only consumers must check `getIndexState`
  first and treat `degraded` as "not available" (blast does).
- `getIndexState(repoId)` → status plus `indexing?: boolean` (true while an
  index/refresh/resync job for the repo is queued or running; the repo can still
  have a usable index at the same time). For a `partial` index, `reason` is
  `soft_budget` or `graph_failed` when the pipeline stopped for that cause: in
  both cases `file_facts` / graph-derived data is incomplete.
- `getUnresolvedReferences(repoId, …)` → phantom-symbol detection (used by L06).
- `getConventionSamples(repoId)` → top-ranked files for convention extraction (L02).

In the starter, only `getRepoMap` / `getFileRank` / `getCallerSignatures` are
wired — into `modules/reviews/run-executor.ts`, which adds the repo map and a
high-blast-radius note to the prompt. Toggled by `REPO_INTEL_ENABLED` (global)
and a per-agent `repo_intel` flag.

## Routes

- `GET /repos/:id/index-state` — index status (drives the **Indexed** badge).
- `POST /repos/:id/resync` — enqueue a re-index.

There are no blast routes here: the PR-scoped read lives in `modules/blast`
(`GET /pulls/:id/blast-radius`), because resolving a PR's changed files and
workspace scoping are PR concerns and this module is PR- and tenant-agnostic.
